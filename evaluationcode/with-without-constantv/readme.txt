This compares two evaluations of the val set: one where the velocity was inferred by the network and one where a constant fixed velocity was used. The comparison is done based on the dice scores: for every tumor in the val set, we compare for every available calculated dice score what the difference is between fixed velocity and inferred velocity. We can expect that the diff is almost purely numerical. Always put 16 evalresults*.pkl in the corresponding directory (constantv and noconstantv). The directories here contain the results based on 0512-12-35-48-epoch37 (see zipped files in evaluationcode directory)
You can use this code also to compare noconstantv and randomv, as long as you put them in the two separate directories "constantv" (put here 16 evalresults with randomv) and "noconstantv" (put here 16 evalresults with network predicted velocity).
The code says "noconstantv" and "constantv" because it was initially coded to compare the two, but you can use it to compare two arbitrary different evaluations, don't get confused by the "constantv" and "noconstantv" notation.
