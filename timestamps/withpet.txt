"0711-17-53-22": works but has oscillations, using l2+convnet+weightdecay+nodropout leads also to oscillations ("1011-10-16-13"), reducing numthrs=2 ("0911-11-13-26") does also not solve the problem

we find the cause: BN or no BN? Two similar architectures trained: 2211-16-28-14 (has BN) vs 2211-18-50-33 (no BN) --> the one without BN does not have oscillations!
